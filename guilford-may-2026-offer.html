          <h2>Custom Program Overview: International Model of Sport</h2>
          <p><strong>To:</strong> Professor Dr. Michael White, Professor Mike DeGeorge, Sarah M. T. Munro, Director Office of Global & Off-Campus Initiatives</p>
          <p><strong>From:</strong> Arno Langevoort, <span class="brand-name">Sport Study Abroad</span> Team</p>

        <section class="proposal-section" id="introduction">
          <p>Dear Michael, Mike, and Sarah,</p>
          <p>Thank you for your valuable time during our recent yearly planning meeting. As a valued long-term partner, it's always a pleasure collaborating with Guilford College, and we particularly enjoyed discussing your vision for the upcoming International Model of Sport faculty-led study abroad experience. We understand your primary goals for this program include providing students with a first-hand, culturally-diverse experience that will inform them of the rapidly globalized nature of the sports industry, while also giving them an opportunity to examine both the similarities and differences between the International Model of Sport and our own domestic approach. Through game day opportunities, interviews/lectures with sport leaders, tours of culturally-significant sites, and traditional didactic study, students will gain a new perspective of the sports industry and build a network of global contacts.</p>
          <p>Based on your preferences for a program in Southern Europe and an emphasis on the rapidly globalized nature of the sports industry, and to examine both the similarities and differences between the International Model of Sport and the domestic approach, we envision your program falling under our Signature Program model. This document outlines the comprehensive framework of how we bring your academic goals to life internationally.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="proposal-section signature-program" id="signature-program">
          <h3>Your Custom Program Model: Signature Program (Comprehensive Experience)</h3>
          <p>Every <span class="brand-name">Sport Study Abroad</span> program is designed to deliver a high-impact, academically rigorous experience, precisely tailored to your curriculum. Your program for Guilford College will integrate our two core pillars with your specific academic focuses:</p>
          <h4>Core Pillar 1: Global Sport Business in Context:</h4>
          <p><strong>How it's delivered:</strong> We design immersive experiences exploring the structures, finances, and operational strategies of international sport. This includes behind-the-scenes access to major sport organizations, clubs, and governing bodies in your chosen European destination. You can expect meetings with senior industry executives, and gain insights into sport marketing, management, and law. Our programs delve into topics like club ownership models, financial fair play, broadcasting rights, and talent development pathways, providing a foundation for comparison of domestic and international sport organizations and operations.</p>
          <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> Most topics are covered directly at the sport venue or institute of the lecturer, providing an extraordinary, contextual learning experience.</p>
          <h4>Core Pillar 2: Cultural & Sociological Immersion:</h4>
          <p><strong>How it's delivered:</strong> Beyond the sport business, your program will emphasize the deep connection between sport, culture, and society. We ensure ample opportunities for multicultural engagement within your chosen destination, including attending live sporting events and games. This also includes organized visits to culturally significant historic sites, local markets, and cultural events, fostering a broader perspective on how sport reflects and shapes identity, history, and community. Students gain an understanding of sport in a global society, and develop the ability to identify sport-related issues in different countries, cultures, and societies.</p>

        <section class="proposal-section" id="focus-tracks">
            <h3>Your Academic Focus Tracks: The International Model of Sport & Global Industry Comparison:</h3>
            <p>We will weave the specific course objectives of the International Model of Sport directly into the itinerary. We would specifically tailor lectures and visits to highlight elements such as examining the similarities and differences between the International Model of Sport and the domestic approach. Representatives from top international sport organizations will address a wide range of subjects/issues, including the structure and characteristics of international sports, marketing and management, sports law, sports medicine/performance, and specific sports like professional tennis/cricket. This ensures a seamless integration with your diverse syllabus objectives, providing opportunities to network with professionals in each country and examine possibilities for building a professional career abroad.</p>

        <section class="proposal-section" id="logistics">
          <h3>Seamless Logistics: How We Handle Everything</h3>
          <p>Our goal is to ensure you can focus entirely on teaching and enriching your students' experience. <span class="brand-name">Sport Study Abroad</span> manages every logistical detail from start to finish.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Expert Itinerary Design:</strong> We collaborate with you on optimal locations to craft a custom itinerary covering your preferred options:</li>
            <li>Option 1: Madrid, Porto, Salamanca, and Lisbon OR</li>
            <li>Option 2: Milan, Nice/Monaco, Nimes, and Barcelona.</li>
            <li>This ensures the route flows efficiently and maximizes learning opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>Specific Customizations:</strong> We meticulously arrange all program elements, including accommodation (hotel with breakfast, twin/triple occupancy), course excursions, visits, lectures, workshops, and activities as outlined in the program.</li>
            <li><strong>Comprehensive Ground Arrangements:</strong> All transportation within the program is by public transport or private bus, ensuring safety, punctuality, and quicker navigation through city traffic where applicable. Accommodation is provided in carefully selected, vetted tourist-class hotels, typically with twin/triple occupancy.</li>
            <li><strong>On-Site Management:</strong> Every program is led by a dedicated, private tour manager who understands your group's needs. Your tour manager handles all time schedules, appointments, tickets for games/events, and official group dinners.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Simplicity:</strong> Predefined meals (including 1 group dinner) and attendance to lectures/games/activities are included, simplifying student budgeting. All accommodations include breakfast.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Your Role:</strong> You only have to worry about one thing: choosing the best restaurant for dinner.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="proposal-section" id="support">
            <h3>Safety, Support & Academic Integration</h3>
            <p><strong>Unwavering Safety Commitment:</strong> With over 15 years of travel experience and a flawless safety record, student well-being is our paramount concern. All programs include local support, and we work with your university to ensure comprehensive insurance is in place.</p>
            <p><strong>Academic Credit:</strong> This course will be an elective available to any Guilford College student, not just sport studies majors, and will also provide credit toward the sociocultural general education requirement for graduation from Guilford College. The three-week portion of the course will include didactic reading/learning, followed by an 11-day excursion to the selected countries, and will conclude with a final project submitted in the week following the trip. We are happy to help you find the best solution for your curricular requirements.</p>
            <p><strong>Group Size:</strong> This program is designed to accommodate a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, with a preferred size ranging from a minimum of 20 students (+2 faculty) to a maximum of 35+ students (+3 faculty). To maximize participation and foster inter-university connections, this program is open to students from other institutions (e.g., GMU) to join.</p>

          <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
          <p>When evaluating these two exciting itinerary options, please consider the following points regarding game attendance and logistical flexibility:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Ticket Availability for Season Finales:</strong><br>
            Option 1 (Madrid, Porto, Lisbon): Both proposed weekends within this itinerary might coincide with the final match of the season in their respective leagues (La Liga and Portuguese Primeira Liga). This could make obtaining tickets for both matches significantly more challenging and potentially more expensive.<br>
            Option 2 (Milan, Nice/Monaco, Nimes, Barcelona): While the Sunday, May 24 game in Barcelona is expected to be the last game of the La Liga season, the Sunday, May 17 game in Milan is anticipated to be a strong option for live sport, potentially being a team's last home game of the Serie A season. The proximity of numerous Serie A games around Milan offers additional opportunities for live sport experiences (e.g., Atalanta vs. Bologna, Como vs. Parma, Genoa vs. AC Milan, Inter vs. Verona, Juventus vs. Fiorentina on May 17; AC Milan vs. Cagliari, Cremonese vs. Como, Torino vs. Juventus, Verona vs. AS Roma on May 24).</li>
            <li><strong>Itinerary Reversal:</strong><br>
            Option 1 (Lisbon to Madrid): Reversing this itinerary would not be as logistically sensible, primarily because the proposed games in Lisbon are scheduled for the weekend of May 16-17, and there are no major games available in Lisbon on the weekend of May 24, which would be the final weekend if the itinerary were reversed.<br>
            Option 2 (Milan to Barcelona): This itinerary can be efficiently run in reverse order (starting in Barcelona and ending in Milan). This offers valuable flexibility for flight arrangements and logistical planning.</li>
          </ul>
